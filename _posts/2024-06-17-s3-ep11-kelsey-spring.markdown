We discuss the Spring Energy Debacle with Professional Food Scientist Kelsey Banaszynski, who is also the Operations Director for the High Lonesome 100 and a 100-mile finisher herself. She lives in Buena Vista, CO and currently works for Campbell Soup Company.

Spring Energy has recently come under scrutiny for the validity of their nutritional claims on their products. In the episode, we recap the factual findings and discuss how this could have happened at Spring, how Spring should and can respond, and discuss how we should move forward to build trust not just in Spring, but in the whole running nutrition industry. We also reject some of the more toxic drama that is associated with this story.
