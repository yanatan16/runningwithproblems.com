Miranda ran her birthday miles at [Rocky's Backyard ultra](https://www.runningwildusa.com/rockysbackyard.html). After Miranda and Jon recap the race, they have a short discussion on the links between altitude and mental health, inspired from a [recent Trail Runner Magazine article](https://www.trailrunnermag.com/training/exploring-the-connection-between-mental-health-and-high-altitude/).
