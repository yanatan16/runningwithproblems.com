Miranda and Jon discuss the recent controversy surrounding Camille Herron (and her husband and coach, Connor Holt) involving wikipedia editing of multiple elite ultrarunners' pages, as well as her own. The discussion ranges from money's impact on Ultrarunning to emotional motivations for personal promotion.

We do not support bullying in any form. Our discussion is meant to focus on the larger issues and changes in ultrarunning, not to beat down on Camille or her husband. More resources at [stopbullying.gov](https://www.stopbullying.gov).
