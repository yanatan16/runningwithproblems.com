Courtney Boyle lost her son suddenly, and in her grief, turned to ultrarunning. We dive into her story and the grief process, from the beginnings to the tailings. Jon and Miranda share their stories with grief and running.

Please consider donating to the [Teddy Bruce Fund for ADHD](https://teddybrucememorialfund.org) in honor of Teddy, Courtney's son.
