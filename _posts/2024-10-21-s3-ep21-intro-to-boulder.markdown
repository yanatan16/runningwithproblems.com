Lauren and Kate join Miranda and Jon to discuss transitioning from traditional-style runners on the coasts to becoming true Boulder mountain runners. Lauren recently finished Run Rabbit Run 100 Miler (her first 100!) and Kate just finished Run Rabbit Run 50 Miler (her first 50!). We discuss a Business Insider article: ["I regret moving to Boulder, Colorado. I thought I'd fit right in, but it was the loneliest two years of my life."](https://www.businessinsider.com/moved-maryland-boulder-colorado-loney-regret-lessons-2023-8)

In the check-in, Miranda and Jon recap some recent navigation running and orienteering they've been doing.
