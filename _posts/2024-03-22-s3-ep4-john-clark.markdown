John Clarke's been obsessed with the Barkley Marathons for years now. We discuss his obsession and his training for this year's race. 

Congratulations to the five finishers of the 2024 Barkley Marathons!!!

Miranda's mic during the episode has poor quality. Rest assured, Jon has already purchased better microphones!
