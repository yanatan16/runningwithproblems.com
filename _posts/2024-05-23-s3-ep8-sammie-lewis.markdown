Sammie Lewis is the cofounder of Golden Endurance, a Physical Therapy and Endurance Coaching business in Golden, CO. She is a very good runner who has dealt with more than her share of difficulty, mostly from Ankylosing Spondylitis. In this episode, we dive into much of that difficulty and how she built a business around the run community.
